## About This Project

A full analysis of this textual variant, including this dataset, has been published in _Filología Neotestamentaria_ vol. 33 (see the next section for full bibliographic reference).

Since the time of this publication, images for more Gospels manuscripts and lectionaries have become available at the INTF Virtual Manuscript Room (http://ntvmr.uni-muenster.de/) and the CSNTM manuscript library (http://www.csntm.org/Library/Manuscripts), so this collation is not exhaustive.
