# luke-9-35-collation
Collation data and notes on over 4000 manuscripts of Luke, over 2500 of which have currently accessible data and over 2100 of which are extant in Luke 9:35.

## About the Project

A full analysis of this textual variant, including this dataset, has been published in Joey McCollum, "Luke 9,35 and the Power of Polygenesis," _Filología Neotestamentaria_ 33.53 (2020), 51–93.

Since the time of this publication, images for more Gospels manuscripts and lectionaries have become available at the INTF Virtual Manuscript Room (http://ntvmr.uni-muenster.de/) and the CSNTM manuscript library (http://www.csntm.org/Library/Manuscripts), so this collation is not exhaustive.
